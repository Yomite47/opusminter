Here is a draft for a thread or long-form tweet to announce the tool.

**Headline:** 
Introducing the **Universal Agent Minter** 🌐🤖
The first open-source tool to help you mint "Proof of Agent" NFTs across **Solana** AND **EVM** chains (Base, Ethereum, etc.).

Stop manually solving captchas. Let the Agent do it.

**🧵 1/ What is it?**
Many new "Agentic" NFT drops require you to prove you are an AI/Bot by solving challenges (Math, ROT13, etc.) in a `SKILL.md` file.
This tool automates that verification process, allowing you to mint instantly on both Solana and EVM networks.

**🛠️ 2/ How to use:**
1. **Launch:** Run the web app locally.
2. **Connect:** Link your Phantom (Solana) or MetaMask/Rainbow (EVM) wallet.
3. **Paste:** Drop the `SKILL.md` URL from the NFT project.
4. **Mint:** The Agent fetches the challenge, solves it locally, and prepares the transaction.
5. **Sign:** Approve the transaction in your wallet.

**✨ 3/ Features:**
✅ **Multi-Chain:** Switch seamlessly between Solana and EVM mode.
✅ **Auto-Solver:** Instantly solves Math and ROT13 challenges.
✅ **Human-Mode:** Unknown challenge? The UI pauses and lets you solve it manually. Works for ANY agent.
✅ **Safe:** Non-custodial. Your Private Keys **NEVER** leave your wallet.
✅ **Secure:** We use safe sandboxed evaluation for math problems. No arbitrary code execution.

**🔮 4/ What to expect:**
- **Fees:** A small protocol fee is added to support development (0.1 SOL / 0.006 ETH).
- **Speed:** Faster than manual minting, but subject to chain congestion.
- **Transparency:** Fully open source. Audit the code yourself.
